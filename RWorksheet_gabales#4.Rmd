## 1. The table below shows the data about shoe size and height. Create a data frame.
```{}
> dframe <- data.frame(
+   Shoesize = c(6.5, 9.0, 8.5, 8.5, 10.5, 7.0, 9.5, 9.0, 13.0, 7.5, 10.5, 8.5, 12.0, 10.5, 
+                13.0, 11.5, 8.5, 5.0, 10.0, 6.5, 7.5, 8.5, 10.5, 8.5, 10.5, 11.0, 9.0, 13.0),
+   height = c(66.0, 68.0, 64.5, 65.0, 70.0, 64.0, 70.0, 71.0, 72.0, 64.0, 74.0, 67.0, 71.0, 71.0, 
+               77.0, 72.0, 59.0, 62.0, 72.0, 66.0, 64.0, 67.0, 73.0, 69.0, 72.0, 70.0, 69.0, 70.0),
+   gender = c("F", "F", "F", "F", "M", "F", "F", "F", "M", "F", "M", "F", "M", "M", 
+               "M", "M", "F", "F", "M", "F", "F", "M", "M", "F", "M", "M", "M", "M"))
> dframe
   Shoesize height gender
1       6.5   66.0      F
2       9.0   68.0      F
3       8.5   64.5      F
4       8.5   65.0      F
5      10.5   70.0      M
6       7.0   64.0      F
7       9.5   70.0      F
8       9.0   71.0      F
9      13.0   72.0      M
10      7.5   64.0      F
11     10.5   74.0      M
12      8.5   67.0      F
13     12.0   71.0      M
14     10.5   71.0      M
15     13.0   77.0      M
16     11.5   72.0      M
17      8.5   59.0      F
18      5.0   62.0      F
19     10.0   72.0      M
20      6.5   66.0      F
21      7.5   64.0      F
22      8.5   67.0      M
23     10.5   73.0      M
24      8.5   69.0      F
25     10.5   72.0      M
26     11.0   70.0      M
27      9.0   69.0      M
28     13.0   70.0      M
```
**a. Describe the data.**

According to the data, each gender has different shoe size and height.

**b. Find the mean of shoe size and height of the respondents. Copy the codes and results.**
```{}
> mean_shoesize <- mean(dframe$Shoesize)
> mean_shoesize
[1] 9.410714
> 
> mean_height <- mean(dframe$height)
> mean_height
[1] 68.55357
```
**c. Is there a relationship between shoe size and height? Why?**

Yes, there is a relationship between shoe size and height. This is because, as we can see from the given table, taller people tend to have larger shoe sizes.

## 2. Construct character vector months to a factor with factor() and assign the result to factor_months_vector. Print out factor_months_vector and assert that R prints out the factor levels below the actual values.
**Consider data consisting of the names of months:**
```{}
        "March","April","January","November","January",
        "September","October","September","November","August",
        "January","November","November","February","May","August",
        "July","December","August","August","September","November","February","April")
        
> months_vector <- c("March","April","January","November","January",
+                    "September","October","September","November","August",
+                    "January","November","November","February","May","August",
+                    "July","December","August","August","September","November","February","April")
> factor_months_vector <- factor(months_vector)
> factor_months_vector
 [1] March     April     January   November  January   September October   September November  August    January   November  November 
[14] February  May       August    July      December  August    August    September November  February  April    
Levels: April August December February January July March May November October September
```
## 3. Then check the summary() of the months_vector and factor_months_vector.
**Interpret the results of both vectors. Are they both equally useful in this case?**
```{}
> summary(months_vector,factor_months_vector)
   Length     Class      Mode 
       24 character character 
```
## 4. Create a vector and factor for the table below.
***Note: Apply the factor function with required order of the level***
***new_order_data <- factor(factor_data,levels = c("East","West","North"))***
***print(new_order_data)***
```{}
> direction <- c("East", "West", "North")
> direction
[1] "East"  "West"  "North"
> factor_direction <- factor(direction)
> factor_direction
[1] East  West  North
Levels: East North West
> 
> frequency <- c(1,4,3)
> frequency
[1] 1 4 3
> factor_frequency <- factor(frequency)
> factor_frequency
[1] 1 4 3
Levels: 1 3 4
> 
> new_order_data <- factor(factor_data,levels = c("East","West","North"))
> print(new_order_data)
[1] <NA> <NA> <NA>
Levels: East West North
```
## 5. Enter the data below in Excel with file name = import_march.csv
**a. Import the excel file into the Environment Pane using read.table() function.**
**Write the code.**
```{}
install.packages("readxl")
library(readxl)

df <- read_excel("C:\\Users\\asus\\Desktop\\GABALES_BSIT2A\\import_march.csv.xlsx")
```
**b. View the dataset. Write the code and its result.**
```{}
> print(df)
